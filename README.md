The workbooks supplied in this repository both run Ansys APDL (which requires an Ansys license). 
They are used to calculate the first bending natural frequency for the structures described in the paper "Anomaly Detection in Offshore Wind Turbine
Structures using Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling", for a range of different stiffnesses.

If there are any questions on implementation, please contact the author Simon Brealy via sbrealy1.sheffield.ac.uk or simonsmith0912@gmail.com
